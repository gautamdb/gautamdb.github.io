# Milk products
## Friday, 30th of August, 2024
A while ago, I decided to start getting fresh, unprocessed milk for daily consumption. Why? Because all milk we get from supermarkets is processed: It is heated to high temperatures, filtered, etc. etc. And the taste is just not the same.

So for a while now, I've made it a habit to get milk from the nearest farm which sells it. The price is usually 1 Euro/Liter in any given farm.

First thing after bringing the milk home, I heat it to 75-85 degrees celsius, and then let it cool down until it reaches 45-50 degrees celsius.
I then separate some of the milk in another vessel to make yoghurt, see below. I let the rest of the milk cool down a bit more, fill it in bottles, and put it in the fridge.

This is how I make yoghurt from the warm milk: Add a spoon of yoghurt to it, and stir it. (The spoon of yoghurt is either greek yoghurt from the supermarket, or a spoon of my own yoghurt from last time.)
This vessel is then is left covered, standing outside in room temperature: When it is warm, for about 10 hours, when it is colder, maybe even 24 hours or a bit longer. The end result is then a vessel full of yoghurt.

I started doing this in the summer, and until now, yoghurt making has been working. It is important to let the yoghurt settle and not refrigerate it too fast, otherwise it does not get the typical yoghurt consistency. 
I am curious how long this will actually work. Who knows, maybe in winter it won't work anymore?

The yoghurt usually stays fine for a week, but sometimes you are unlucky and it goes bad after 4 days.

About the milk: It usually stays fine for 3-6 days in the fridge. This time, a lot of the milk went bad on day 3. But milk which goes bad in "the right way" can actually be processed further, and I am currently experimenting with this.

The milk had separated into cream, which was at the top of the bottle, and stuff below. The cream was just fat, and I could use it on a slice of bread just like butter. 
The stuff below consisted of slightly chunky pieces in the white fluid. It tasted a little like yoghurt. I put this in a bowl, and left it in the fridge, thinking it will become yoghurt.

When I checked two days later, it had separated into a white-yellowish liquid, which I think is whey, and white, more solid stuff. 
I separated the fluid from the solid as best as I could (see here: [1](separating_1.jpg) [2](separating_2.jpg) [3](separated.jpg)), drank some of the whey (it tastes of almost nothing, and is supposed to be quite healthy), and filtered the solid stuff with a cloth (see here: [1](filtering_1.jpg) [2](filtering_2.jpg) [3](filtered.jpg)).

I think this is how cheese or cottage cheese is made.

I have now put the solid stuff, which is wrapped in a cloth, between two plates, and put a weight on it to compress it (see here: [1](compressing_1.jpg) [2](compressing_2.jpg)). Leaving it like that for 5 hours, and checking on it after that!
