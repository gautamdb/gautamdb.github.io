How is my Ph.D. going?
When you are at school and all your classmates get As and Bs in the exam, and you get a C - you still pass, but are clearly worse than average.
But the teacher is still encouraging, so you still enjoy the class.

That's basically how I'm feeling.

I started my Ph.D. in May 2022. There have been many angles of thought I have been pursuing. In the last 2 years, one of my main activities has been to understand the local existence proof for classical solutions of Vlasov-Poisson in more detail. I mainly use [this](https://doi.org/10.1016/S1874-5717(07)80008-9) reference. My aim, which I am working towards, is to extend the proof by allowing initial values from the space of continuously differentiable L1-L-infinity functions. What I have already accomplished is removing the requirement that the initial value needs to be non-negative: Everything works just fine even when the initial value function is allowed negative values.

Because of becoming a father and the challenges which are part and parcel of it, during the months October 2024 up until today, I have been able to do as good as no work. Today is the first day where I have actually effectively worked.
