# Luke 13,11

»And behold, there was a woman who had had a disabling spirit for eighteen years. She was bent over and could not fully straighten herself.«

Have we not all experienced situations where we were ill and were unhappy with it? I am very lucky that I never had a chronic disease, like the woman in the verse above. And even then, even me, when I am ill, sometimes ask myself "God is almighty, why doesn't He free me from this illness?"

The question which this verse provokes for me is this: Okay, so it describes that Jesus heals her, now after eighteen years. (That is written in the next verses.) But why only now? Why did she have to endure no less than EIGHTEEN years of being crippled until she received healing from Jesus?

Let us try and extract the obvious from this verse: 

First, note that this woman had come to the Synagogue on Sabbath. She was there, in Gods house, which shows that she had (at least on this Sabbath) not kept away from God.

Second, the illness is not described as just an illness, it is clearly stated that it is caused by a spirit.

Okay, so she was crippled by a spirit, was in the Synagogue on the Sabbath. Does the story explicitly state that she was in the Synagogue every Sabbath, praying for healing? No. Does the story say that she was ususally never in the Synagogue, and that this time was an exception? No. We don't even know if she was actually praying for healing at that moment.

I take a few main messages from this verse. First: We cannot think that God always immediately heals us from a chronic disease when we pray. This might happen, but God may also allow it that we are plagued by a chronic disease for as long as eighteen years. The deeper message here is that what God gives us is not about outwardly visible well-being, but well-being within. We do not need to wait to be healed from daily pain, or a spirit plaguing us, to be with God.
Second: The woman is a real role model, who actually does exactly this: She lives with her infirmity, she lives with the spirit of infirmity, for eighteen years, and does not let this keep her away from God. However her attitude on other days, on this Sabbath, she is ready and interested to come to the Synagogue. (Assuming nobody forced or pressured her to come, which seems unlikely to me.) So we should learn from her: Don't let feelings about your own infirmities and bad spirits plaguing you keep you away from God. He is still there and cares about you, even when He doesn't heal you for a long time.

And finally, it tells me the following: Even after eighteen years of illness, even after eighteen years of being plagued by a bad spirit, there is hope that God sets you free.

Be blessed, in the name of Jesus.
