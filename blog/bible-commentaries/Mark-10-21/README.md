# Mark 10,21

»And Jesus, looking at him, loved him, and said to him, "You lack one thing: go, sell all that you have and give to the poor, and you will have treasure in heaven; and come, follow me."«

The man who came to Jesus is seeking the eternal life. And he is asking Jesus what to do to get it. As many other passages in the New Testament describe, we cannot earn eternal life by our deeds, precisely because we as humans are inherently flawed. We can receive eternal life despite our failiure to be free from bad.

A few verses earlier, Jesus alludes to this fact by saying that "No one is good except God alone." In my opinion, He does not mean that there is no good in people, but rather that there is always some bad in people which they are not able to get rid of, and so God alone is entirely good.

But nevertheless, Jesus gives a straight answer to the direct question, and tells the man what is in theory necessary to get eternal life. It is, plainly, to follow commandments. The commandments of God are not there to condemn, but to actually let the people know what God wants us to do.

It is said that Jesus "looking at him, loved him" because He sees not only that this man seeks eternal life and knows to come to the right address, Jesus, to ask about it. In the verses before, the man states that he has followed those commands which Jesus deems important since his youth. So does this mean that the love of Jesus depends on us trying to be good people, and loves this man because he is trying to be a good person?

That is not exactly true. See the contrast of what Jesus says earlier, that "No one is good except God alone." No, this man is not following the commandments with the main motivation that he wants to try to be a good person. He seeks God, this becomes clear by the fact that he approaches Jesus and his first question is about eternal life.

The life we are given with birth is finite. We are painfully made aware of that by the presence of death. But the life with God is eternal. And God loves those who seek this eternal life. The commandments tell us what God wants us to do, and lead us into the meaning of eternal life with God. 

Luckily, it does not depend on us to keep all commandments to inherit this eternal life. Jesus describes how difficult it is, especially for those with many possessions, for those who have wealth to enter the kingdom of God: "It is easier for a camel to go through the eye of a needle than for a rich person to enter the kingdom of God." When the disciples ask Him "Who can then be saved?", his reply is clear: "With man it is impossible, but not with God. For all things are possible with God."

But now back to the verse at hand, Mark 10,21. Here Jesus describes the one commandment which the man who came to Jesus lacks. He tells him two things: First, get rid of your possessions, giving to the needy all that you have. This gives you treasure in heaven. Second, follow me.

God wants us to collect treasure in heaven and get rid of possessions here on earth. This is obviously hard to digest, and most people cannot actually accomplish it. Most people are like the man with many possesions. But it is one of the things Jesus makes it clear here that God wants.

Jesus also makes it clear that God wants the poor to be taken care of -  they are the ones who need our excess possesions, or the money we can get from selling it.

Finally, Jesus makes it clear that God wants us to follow Him.
