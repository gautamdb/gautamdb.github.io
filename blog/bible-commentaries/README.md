# Bible commentaries

These are just my personal musings, I hope they may be nice to read for anyone.

Disclaimer: The views and opinions expressed in these commentaries are the thoughts I had in the moment of writing them. My opinions may change over time, and I am open and interested in discussing anything, and changing my views when confronted with other viewpoints. I am also not representing "the" christian view of any particular group of believers.
