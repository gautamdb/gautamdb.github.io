As a student, I did some programming while working in student assistant jobs at the university. Some of these jobs produced academic publications or preprints: [This](https://ris.utwente.nl/ws/portalfiles/portal/30050558/Scheider2017exploratory.pdf) is from my work at the institute for geoinformatics in Münster, [this](https://arxiv.org/abs/1702.06309) is from my work at the institute for applied mathematics in Münster, and [this](https://jexpmath.org/index.php/jem/article/view/Vol-1Issue-1Paper-1/Vol-1Issue-1Paper-1) is from my work at the visual computing group in Heidelberg.
